mstflint: A BURNING FIRMWARE APPLICATION
----------------------------------------

1) Overview
    This package contains a burning tool for Mellanox manufactured HCA cards.
    It also provides access to the relevant source code. Please see the file
    LICENSE for licensing details.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NOTE:
    This burning tool should be used only with Mellanox-manufactured
    HCA cards. Using it with cards manufactured by other vendors may be harmful
    to the cards (due to different configurations).
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
2) Package Contents
    a) mstflint source code.
    b) mtcr linux utility.
       This utility enables the mstflint burning utility to access the HCA
       hardware registers.


3) Installation
    a) Build the the mstflint utility.
        Example: 
        make

    b) Compilation should end with no error messages.
        For example:
	>make
	g++ -g -I. -O2 -fno-exceptions flint.cpp -o mstflint

    c) An executable mstflint will be generated in the current directory
       This is the mstflint utility that can be used to burn and examine
       the HCA on-board flash. You may copy this executable to an arbitrary
       location.

4) Requirements:
    a) Typically, you will need root privileges for flash access

    b) You will need the binary firmware-image file supplied by your HCA card
       vendor.

	If you purchased your card from Mellanox, please use the Mellanox
	secured site with your customer login account to download the firmware
	binaries, or contact your local field application engineer.

       Or

	If you purchased your card from a vendor other than Mellanox, get a
	specific board file from your HCA card vendor and generate the binary
	image.

    c) You must know the device location on the PCI bus.
       For example, to find an InfiniHost HCA car manufactured by Mellanox use:

       /sbin/lspci -d 15b3:5a44
       02:00.0 InfiniBand: Mellanox Technology: Unknown device 5a44 (rev a1)

	In this example, 02:00.0 identifies the device in the form bus:dev.fn
	
5) Usage:
	Read mstflint usage. Enter: "./mstflint -h" for detailed help,

	Use mstflint to burn a device according to the burning instructions. 
	You will need to specify the device in the form bus:dev.fn as explained
	in section 4c) above, or in the alternative form
        /proc/bus/pci/bus/dev.fn .

       Examples:
       1) mstflint -d 02:00.0 v

	
       In the above example, mstflint reads the /proc/bus/pci/devices
	to find the physical address of device Region0 (AKA BAR0)
	and checks that the region size is exactly 0.
	It then accesses this region by means of the /dev/mem device.

       2) mstflint -d /proc/bus/pci/02/00.0 v

	This example accesses the device PCI configuration registers
	by means of the specified file under the /proc/bus/pci
	directory, and performs flash access by writing these
	registers.


7) Problem Reporting:
	Please collect the following information when reporting issues:

	uname -a
	cat /etc/issue
	cat /proc/bus/pci/devices
	lspci
        mstflint -d 02:00.0 v
        mstflint -d 02:00.0 q
